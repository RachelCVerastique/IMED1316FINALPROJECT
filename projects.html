                <p>
                    The Movies project was a single-page application developed using paired
                    programming. The movies project utilizes a mock database as well as the Open
                    Movie Database API. A visitor to the page can add, edit, rate, and delete movies.
                    This application was constructed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap frameworks for
                    the front-end in addition to Javascript and JQuery for backend calls to the API.

                <p>
                    The weather map project was independently built and uses the OpenWeatherMap
                    and Mapbox APIs. This application allows users to acquire a five-day weather
                    forecast based on the desired location using a dynamic weather map with markers
                    and weather cards that correspond with geolocation inputs such as
                    longitude/latitude, an address, or landmark names. This project was developed
                    using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap frameworks to generate page elements on the
                    front-end while Javascript and JQuery were used to make ajax requests to the
                    APIs.

                    ease of use in searching by name and roast types. This application allows for
                    addition of new products as well as predictive text using active filtration. The
                    project was built using HTML, CSS, and javascript. Jquery was utilized to allow for
                    domain object model manipulation.
