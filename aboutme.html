        <p class="bio">Hi, my name is Rachel. It's nice to meet you.
            I am currently a stay home mother of four children.
            I previously worked in the veterinary field as a veterinary assistant.
            I did everything from assisting the veterinarians with preventive care appointments
            to assisting in complex surgeries. Due to lifes twists and turns I was unable to
            pursue my passion with animals in becoming a licensed veterinary technician. One day out
            of nowhere I decided to spontaneously make a transition into web development and discovered a new
            passion. In 2021 I enrolled in a local coding bootcamp for Full Stack Web Development and completed
            it in June of 2022.
        </p>

        <p class="bio">
            While in the process of job hunting I knew I wanted to learn as much as I could. At that
            point I decided to go back to college, and I am currently enrolled and in the process of attaining
            an associates degree in Web and Mobile Development. My projected graduation is summer of 2024.
        </p>

        <p class="bio">
            My current goal is to help small business owners, such as stay at home crafters, to build custom websites
            to attract customers to purchase their products. This will greatly help me to gain more experience working with
            clients and building better websites.

            Have an idea? Go on over to my contact me page and let's get the ball rolling!
